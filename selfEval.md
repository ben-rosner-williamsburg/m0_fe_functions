# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am most proud of the fact that I am reinforcing the concepts around functions that 
were unclear earlier in my software engineering training. Calling and invoking functions is now going smoother than before, and I now understand the difference between returning a value in a function and using console.log.


- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
Functions are a powerful tool in our applications
because they allow us to create our own algorithms that can be repeated for various data values. For tasks when built in methods are not enough or do not fulfill the needed purpose, that is where functions come into play. They can provide step by step instructions for the computer to carry out a task.
